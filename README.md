# icloudfinder
Python script to determine current location of any icloud devices and alert when changes are detected from specified GPS locations. 
After determining the GPS longitude and latitude it uses a scew value to determine if in range of the specified locations or if it's Unknown. Tested as of Jan 2016. Requires using curl and create a credentials json file to logon to icloud.com. Will loop through all Apple devices returned. To run it yourself. Determine your GPS co-ords using google maps and update the homelat, homelong variables in the script, edit the dataemily.txt credential json file and update the TO and mail addresses some you can be notified of changes. If you have multiple apple ID's edit the data.txt and datamsg.txt and the for loop for two additional Apple ID's to use.
